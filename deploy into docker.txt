To deploy the Dockerized AngularJS application, you'll need to consider where you want to deploy it. Below are two common scenarios: deploying to a standalone server and deploying to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.

Deploying to a Standalone Server:
SSH into Your Server:
Access your server using SSH.

Pull Docker Image:
On your server, pull the Docker image you pushed to your Docker registry:

bash
Copy code
docker pull your-docker-registry/your-angular-app:${BUILD_NUMBER}
Run Docker Container:
Run the Docker container on your server:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 80:80 your-docker-registry/your-angular-app:${BUILD_NUMBER}
Adjust the port numbers based on how your Angular application is configured.
